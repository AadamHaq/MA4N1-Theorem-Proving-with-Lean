The proof of [The finite case]([Extensions/Lusin_Finite_Case.lean](https://github.com/AadamHaq/MA4N1-Theorem-Proving-with-Lean/blob/main/Project/Final%20Submission/Extensions/Lusin_Finite_Case.lean) is very similar to that of [the countable case]([Lusin_Theorem_Countable.lean](https://github.com/AadamHaq/MA4N1-Theorem-Proving-with-Lean/blob/main/Project/Final%20Submission/Lusin_Theorem_Countable.lean).
